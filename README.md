# CPP-Caesar-Cipher-Decrypt
These files are used to decrypt any text that uses the caesar cipher, it works by assuming the most common letter is 'e' and calculate the disposition from there. This has no practical use as the caesar cipher is easily broken but feel free to use this at you're pleasure -Sam
